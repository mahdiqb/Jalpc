Numbers and percentages aren't fun to look at, especially when it comes to electoral data. In a political atmosphere filled with dissatisfaction and pessimism, disinterest in the 2018 municipal elections in Tunisia reached unprecedented  levels. To face that, Democracy International opted for a data-driven campaign to help Tunisians get a better understanding of the importance of the upcoming elections and the stakes that are at play.

The campaign used Artificial reality, virtual reality, [3D projection mappings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaHDbPP5VJM&t=86s), and interactive data visualizations. Below are four of the visualizations I created within the campaign:
